# ROS Installation Script for Nvidia Jetson Devices

## Overview

This Bash script automates the installation of ROS (Robot Operating System) on Ubuntu systems. The script checks the Ubuntu version and installs the appropriate ROS version (Hubble, Noetic, or Melodic) accordingly.

## Usage

1. Make it executable

```
chmod +x install_ros.sh
```

2. Run

```
./install_ros.sh.
```


Feel free to modify the script to suit your specific ROS version or Ubuntu release requirements.
